  <h1 class="main">A Brief Overview</h1>

  <p>The <b>Hales Lab</b> is a molecular biology lab in the Emory University School of Medicine and
    <a href="http://www.cnd.emory.edu/">Emory Unversity's Center for
    Neurodegenerative Disease</a> led by Chad Hales MD,PhD.</p>

  <p>We study the molecular mechanisms of <b>Alzheimer's Disease</b>, <b>frontotemporal dementia</b>,
    and related neurodegenerative disorders.

  <p>We use a combination of <b>molecular biology techniques</b>, <b>proteomic
    sequencing</b>, <b>immunohistochemistry</b> of postmortem human brain, <b>induced pluripotent stem cells<b/>, and
    <b>microelectrode array recordings</b> (MEA).

  <p>Our work is supported by the National Institutes of Health and Emory University.</p>
