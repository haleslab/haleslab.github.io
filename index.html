     <h1 class="main">A Brief Overview</h1>

     <p>The <b>Hales Lab</b> is a molecular biology lab in the Emory University School of Medicine and
       <a href="http://www.cnd.emory.edu/">Emory Unversity's Center for
         Neurodegenerative Disease</a> led by Chad Hales MD,PhD.</p>

  <p>We study the molecular mechanisms of <b>Alzheimer's Disease</b>, <b>frontotemporal dementia</b>, <b>chronic traumatic encephalopathy</b>,
    and related neurodegenerative disorders.

  <p>We use a combination of <b>molecular biology techniques</b>, <b>proteomic
    sequencing</b>, <b>immunohistochemistry</b> of postmortem human brain, <b>induced pluripotent stem cells<b/>, and
    <b>microelectrode array recordings</b> (MEA).

  <p>Our work is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Department of Defense, the BrightFocus Foundation and Emory University.
    We are most grateful for support from these organizations</p>
