Please contact me or Camille Sears in the [Emory Office of Financial Development](https://med.emory.edu/giving/contact.html) if you are interested in providing financial support for my research. Conducting research requires significant resources to cover the cost of supplies, personnel and to protect my time for conducting experiments, fostering new ideas and publishing important findings to share with others in the field. Although external grant funding is clearly important, private philanthropy can play a very large role in helping to move the science forward.  Thank you for your consideration.  

I also currently have a clinical research protocol that collects a small skin sample for the back of the arm for stem cell development.  I am especially interested in research subjects with known genetic mutations in frontotemporal dementia associated disorders (MAPT-(R406W, P301L, P301S), progranulin, C9Orf72, TDP43)) as well as other neurodegenerative disorders with known mutations.
