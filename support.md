Please contact me or Katie Dozier in the [Emory Office of Financial Development](http://med.emory.edu/giving/contact.html) if you are interested in providing financial support for my research. Lack of funding is a significant obstacle for moving scientific discoveries forward at a faster rate. 

I also currently have a clinical research protocol that collects a small skin sample for the back of the arm for stem cell development.  I am especially interested in research subjects with known genetic mutations in frontotemporal dementia associated disorders (MAPT-(R406W, P301L, P301S), progranulin, C9Orf72, TDP43) as well as other neurodegenerative disorders with known mutations.
