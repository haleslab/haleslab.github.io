Please contact me if you are interested in providing financial support for my research.

I also currently have a clinical research protocol that collects a small skin sample for the back of the arm for stem cell development.  I am especially interested in research subjects with known genetic mutations in frontotemporal dementia associated disorders (MAPT-(R406W, P301L, P301S), progranulin, C9Orf72, TDP43) as well as other neurodegenerative disorders with known mutations.
