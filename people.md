## **Current Members**

### Chad Hales, M.D., Ph.D.

I am an Assistant Professor of [Neurology](http://www.neurology.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/). My laboratory is in the [Center for Neurodegenerative Disease](http://cnd.emory.edu/) in the Whitehead Biomedical research building on Emory's main campus.

I have post-doctoral training in biomedical engineering and cellular biology.

I am a board certified neurologist with subspecialty certification in Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry. I see patients with all types of cognitive disorders in the [Emory Memory Disorders Clinic](http://alzheimers.emory.edu/).

### James Webster B.S.

James has developed a great repertoire of techniques and is instrumental in keeping the lab up and running.



## **Collaborators**

This is a list of our current collaborators.


### [Peng Jin, Ph.D.](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=124)

Peng is a geneticist interested in trinucleotide repeat disorders, microRNA, and methylation and epigenetic changes as they related to neurodegenerative illnesses. He is particularly interested in Fragile-X associated tremor-ataxia syndrome and G4C2 expanded repeats in C9Orf72 implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.

### [Thomas Kukar, Ph.D.](http://http://www.pharm.emory.edu/tkukar/research.html)

Thomas is a cellar biologist and medicinal chemist interested in understanding dysfunctional cellular mechanisms and therapies for various neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.

### [James Lah, M.D., Ph.D.](http://neurology.emory.edu/faculty/cognitive/lah_james.html)

Jim is a cognitive neurologist, molecular biologist, and mentor, neuroscientist interested in RNA splicing and using proteomics to understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

### [Allan I. Levey, M.D., Ph.D.](http://neurology.emory.edu/faculty/cognitive/levey_allan.html)

Allan is a cognitive neurologist, neuroscientist/neuroanatomist, and mentor.

### [Ann McKee, M.D.](http://http://www.bu.edu/cte/about/leadership/ann-mckee-md/)

Dr. McKee has been instrumental in providing training on the pathologic diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and for providing valuable postmortem human brain samples for use in our experiments to better understand RNA processing dysfunction in CTE and the overlap with AD.

### [Nicholas Seyfried, DPhil.](http://proteox.genetics.emory.edu/emory/people.html)

Nick is a biochemist and knows about as much as anyone should about mass spectrometry. We work closely with him and Duc Duoung for proteomics based experiments.

### [Thomas Wingo, M.D.](http://wingolab.org)

Thomas is interested in understanding the genetics of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.


## **Alumni**

### Zohal Ghulam-Jelani

Zohal was in the Emory SURE program (Summer Undergraduate Research Program) and she is currently applying for medical school. She was working on culturing postmortem human neurons from autopsy research cases.

### Phillip Price

Phillip was a rotating graduate student in the lab and he is currently in the Emory neurosciences program working on his Ph.D. He was working on developing genomic engineering protocols for the lab.
